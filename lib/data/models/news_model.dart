    title: 'ECB to wean banks off free cash at gentlest pace',
    text:
        'FRANKFURT, March 13 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank wants to wean banks off free cash but it will try to do so gently enough not to upset the financial system or lending, the result of its long-awaited Operational Framework Review showed on Wednesday.During nearly a decade of too-low inflation, the central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro currency inundated banks with cash via massive bond purchases, with the aim of spurring them to lend and stimulate price growth.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThat largely removed the need for banks to borrow from each other, and effectively pinned the overnight interest rate on the money market to the one the ECB pays on deposits.But this exceptionally generous system is now proving costly for the ECB and national central banks, and needs adapting for a new era in which inflation and interest rates are higher and the liquidity pumped into the system is being drained.Advertisement · Scroll to continueUnder the new framework unveiled on Wednesday, the ECB will give banks more incentive to lend to each other, while providing safety nets to limit the risk that lenders could run out of cash."The framework will ensure that our policy implementation remains effective, robust, flexible and efficient in the future as our balance sheet normalises," ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a statement.The ECB said the new framework should make its balance sheet "financially sound" after it and the central banks of some euro zone countries suffered large losses as a result of its past largesse.',

          'BOJ to debate ending negative rates in March if wage survey strong - sources',

          'TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will debate ending its negative interest rate policy next week if Friday\'s preliminary survey on big firms\' wage talks outcome yield strong results, sources said, marking a landmark shift away from its decade-long stimulus programme.While investors are increasingly pricing in the chance of a March policy shift, any such decision could affect global financial markets by altering Japan\'s status as a lone supplier of massive cheap money, analysts say.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThis year\'s annual wage talks kicked off in full force on Wednesday with Toyota Motor (7203.T), opens new tab agreeing to give factory workers their biggest pay increase in 25 years, heightening expectations that other companies will follow suit with bumper wage increases.Such early signs of a strong outcome in this year\'s annual wage talks have heightened the chances that the BOJ will phase out its massive monetary stimulus, three sources familiar with its thinking said.Advertisement · Scroll to continueThe central bank is likely to scrutinise a preliminary survey on the wage talks\' outcome, to be released by union umbrella Rengo on Friday, in deciding whether conditions to phase out stimulus have fallen into place, the sources said."There seems to be enough factors that justify a March policy shift," one of the sources said. "In the end, it will be a judgement call by the nine board members," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.',

          'Bitcoin halving: When will it happen and what does it mean for the price?',
      text:
          'LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - As bitcoin\'s price reaches new heights, attention is turning to its upcoming "halving" and whether it is playing a role in its ascent. Depending on where you sit, the halving is a vital event that will burnish bitcoin\'s value as an increasingly scarce commodity, or nothing more than a technical change talked up by speculators to inflate its price. But what exactly is it, and does it really matter? WHAT IS IT? The halving is a change in bitcoin\'s underlying blockchain technology, designed to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are created. Advertisement · Scroll to continue. Bitcoin was designed from its inception by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto to have a capped supply of 21 million tokens. Nakamoto wrote the halving into bitcoin\'s code and it works by reducing the rate at which new bitcoin are released into circulation. So far, about 19 million tokens have been released. HOW DOES IT HAPPEN? Blockchain technology involves creating records of information - called \'blocks\' - which are added to the chain in a process called \'mining\'. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Miners use computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles to build the blockchain and earn rewards in the form of new bitcoin. At the halving, the amount of bitcoin available as rewards for miners is cut in half. This makes mining less profitable and slows the production of new bitcoins. (For a visual explanation of how blockchain works, click here.) WHEN WILL IT HAPPEN? There is no set date, but it is expected to take place in late April.',

          'LONDON/FRANKFURT, March 13 (Reuters) - A year ago Credit Suisse was teetering on the brink of collapse, a scare that sent European bank shares tumbling and the cost of insuring against default soaring.Investors were sounding the alarm about the stability of lenders amid turmoil among regional U.S. banks.

      title: 'HelloFresh investors struggle to swallow strategy revamp',
      text:
          'The company - once a pandemic-era darling - also announced a strategy revamp, including plans to beef up its ready-meal delivery arm to offset flatlining revenue at its core meal-kit business. It lost more than a million active customers in both during the first nine months of last year.It set a goal to boost revenue from ready meals, which analysts estimate make up 20% of sales, by 50% in 2024. That would be the second year of such growth. It also pledged to cut costs, including on marketing, and use more automation to improve productivity.Union Investment, HelloFresh\'s 12th largest shareholder with a 2.9% stake, said the reboot was management\'s "last chance" to restore credibility."If this (does) not succeed, a change will be urgently needed," Union\'s portfolio manager Christian Reindl told Reuters.CEO Dominik Richter will be under pressure to explain his thinking about the overhaul on Friday when the company releases 2023 results.Two thirds being in the affirmative,  Analysts question how the company will spend much-needed cash on promotions and advertising to win new ready-made meal customers given stiff competition from takeaway services, online grocery stores and supermarkets. Jefferies\' analyst Sebastian Patulea said that while ready-to-eat meals could be a multi-billion opportunity, it was unclear if it could make up for the loss of meal-kit revenue, or if it would be easy to expand into Europe. HelloFresh is expanding its U.S. arm Factor to the Netherlands and Belgium.PANDEMIC SURGE Like food delivery and other meal-kit companies, HelloFresh boomed during the pandemic when customers ordered boxes of pre-portioned ingredients to cook at home during lockdown.But now the meal-kits business, its biggest by revenue, is losing customers as people go out more and spend less as inflation hits their pockets."We were wrong in our assumptions ... that we would be able to maintain our margins at some of the peak pandemic levels," Richter told analysts on Friday.Since peaking at 16.6 billion euros (\$18.1 billion) in August 2021, HelloFresh\'s market value has plunged about 90%.U.S. meal-kit rival Blue Apron was bought by startup Wonder Group for \$103 million last year after warning revenue and customer numbers would fall in 2023. It was worth \$1.9 billion when it listed in 2017.Union\'s Reindl expects management to announce more restructuring on Friday.HelloFresh "must come to terms with the fact that the strong growth rates of the coronavirus years are over and address the cost base," he said.The company should either switch meal-kit capacity to boost output of ready-to-eat meals, as that would require less investment than building from scratch, or it will face staff cuts and plant closures, he said, adding it also needed to better target marketing at existing customers.Another change that unsettled investors and analysts was a decision to stop disclosing active customer numbers, a key metric for profitability.To do so at a time of such turmoil was "unfathomable", making accurate analysis of the group harder, UBS analyst Jo Barnet-Lamb said.Ready meals have been successful in the United States, where people grab quick lunches, but in countries such as Italy and Spain people are more likely to socialise over lunch."We think this is the start of a bumpy road," Barnet-Lamb said.',

        'Three Black bankers lose UK race discrimination claim against Barclays',
    text:
        'LONDON (Reuters) - Three Black bankers, who sued Barclays for a combined 52.8 million pounds (\$66.7 million) in London over allegations that included race discrimination, harassment, victimisation and whistleblower detriment, have largely lost their case.In a near 460-page judgment, the East London Employment Tribunal dismissed the bulk of claims brought by Louis Samnick, a former vice president, vice president Christian Abanda Bella and Henry-Serge Moune Nkeng, an assistant vice president.The three men of Cameroonian background, who represented themselves in the lengthy case, had alleged they had been bullied, harassed and denied promotion and appropriate support, in part because of their race.Samnick, a former vice president in the bank\'s credit risk model validation team, and Abanda Bella, a quantitative analyst, succeeded with a claim that Barclays had failed to make reasonable adjustments for their disabilities during a 2019 performance review.In a judgment made public on Wednesday, the judge said health issues faced by Samnick and Abanda Bella were sufficiently significant to allow them compensation for this part of the claim. All other complaints failed.Barclays did not immediately reply to a request for comment and Reuters was unable to reach the claimants.Abanda Bella joined Barclays in 2017 but has been signed off work with depression since 2019. In his 2019 appraisal, carried out in his absence, his performance was assessed as "needs improvement". Samnick, who received the same 2019 performance rating, had been on sick leave since September 2019.Ranked as a vice president for 10 years, Samnick resigned in 2021 after securing another bank job at executive director grade, the judgment showed.A remedy hearing will be called if the parties cannot agree compensation for the single failure to make reasonable adjustments for disabilities.',
